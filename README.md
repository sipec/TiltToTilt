# TiltToTilt
This is a game I helped make with [@75Dragon](https://github.com/75Dragon) back in 2017 as a summer project. We pair programmed the whole thing - he wrote the core gameplay loop and I wrote the collision logic. A few years later, I decided to polish it up and host it on netlify. 

To play the game you use move the ship away from the colored balls and toward the diamond powerups.
